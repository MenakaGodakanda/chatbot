# chatbot
This project demonstrates a Generative AI (GenAI)-based chatbot built using open-source tools. The chatbot uses a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Transformers library to generate responses to user inputs. A Flask web application provides the interface for user interaction, and the project is designed to run on Ubuntu 22.04.
